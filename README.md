## Project Overview

High school seniors are often faced with the daunting task of trying to find college that fit their interests to apply to. Our project is a comprehensive online platform designed to assist high school students (specifically seniors) in their college search and application process. UniPath provides a user-friendly interface where students can explore and compare colleges, access valuable information, and make informed decisions about their future education.

UniPath offers a robust search engine that allows high school senior looking to apply to colleges to filter and search for colleges based on various criteria, such as location, majors offered, campus culture, school values, tuition fees, and admission requirements. Students can view detailed profiles and personalize their accounts through a login/registration. 

Additionally, we implemented 3 additional user roles as strecth features: **parents** to view financial breakdown information for their child's favorited colleges, **college admission officers** to post upcoming events at the institutions they work at that students can then register for, and **college students and alumni to post reviews/ratings** to provide first-hand experience about what it is like to attend their university to help students navigate their college search.
