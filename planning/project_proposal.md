## Problem Statement

High school seniors are often faced with the hefty task of trying to find college that fit their interests to apply to. Our project is a comprehensive online platform designed to assist high school students (specifically seniors) in their college search and application process. It provides a user-friendly interface where students can explore and compare colleges, access valuable information, and make informed decisions about their future education.

## Description

Our project offers a robust search engine that allows high school senior looking to apply to colleges to filter and search for colleges based on various criteria, such as location, majors offered, campus culture, school values, tuition fees, and admission requirements. Students can view detailed profiles and personalize their accounts through a login/registration.

## Expected Features List

Interactive Campus Tours: The website includes virtual tours and interactive maps of college campuses. Students can explore different areas of the campus, view dormitories, classrooms, and facilities, and get a feel for the campus environment from the comfort of their homes.

College Reviews and Ratings: The website features reviews and ratings submitted by current and former students, providing firsthand insights into the college experience. Students can read reviews, learn about campus life, academic rigor, extracurricular opportunities, and student satisfaction.

Scholarships and Financial Aid Information: Our project offers a comprehensive database of scholarships, grants, and financial aid opportunities. Students can search for scholarships based on their eligibility criteria, access application deadlines, and find resources to help them fund their education.

Admissions Statistics: The website provides access to admissions statistics, including acceptance rates, average test scores, GPA requirements, and demographic information. Students can gauge their chances of acceptance based on historical data and evaluate their fit with different colleges.

College Events and Open Houses: Our project lists upcoming college events, open houses, and admission fairs. Students can browse events based on their preferences and register to attend campus tours, information sessions, and meet college representatives virtually or in person.

College Planning Tools: The website offers planning tools, such as a college application checklist, personalized application tracking, and reminders for important deadlines. Students can create profiles to save their favorite colleges, track their progress, and receive personalized recommendations.

## Related Work
Niche.com is a similar platform that allows you to search up specific colleges that you are looking to apply to and get all the information/statistics about that college, BUT our project differs in its personalization based on registered/logged-in user and connecting the user to other students with similar interest at their high school.

## Open Questions

We are concerned about the concepts that this project will require, specifically regarding ...
- Virtual tour implementation (maybe loading in videos from youtube, but not sure how to connect that with the API)
- Display ratings/reviews from all past users (stored in a database)
- Getting an API for a list of scholarships/financial aid opportunities  
- Displaying visualizations (maybe SQL?) for the statistics gathered from API results for college acceptance rates, GPA requirements, and demographics
- Getting an API for a list of college events
