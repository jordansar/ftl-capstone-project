It provides a user-friendly interface where students can explore and compare colleges, access valuable information, and make informed decisions about their future education.

## User Roles

Include at least at least 1, but no more than 3, user roles
1. High school senior
2. Parent of high school senior
3. Current college student/alum
4. College admission officer

## User Personas
Sarah is an 18-year old American high school senior who is looking to apply to colleges this Fall. She is enthusiastic and motivated to pursue higher education, eager to explore new opportunities and broaden her horizons, seeks a supportive and inclusive campus community, and is interested in a college experience that offers a balance between academics, extracurricular activities, and social life. However, she is overwhelmed by the vast amount of information available and the complexity of the college search process, uncertain about the factors to consider when selecting a college, lacks exposure to different colleges and limited guidance from family members or school counselors, and finding it difficult to assess campus culture without visiting each college.

Chris (40yo) and Lisa(40yo) are Sarah's parents. Support their daughter Sarah in finding the best college that meets her academic and personal needs while considering financial aspects. However, they are overwhelmed by the complex and ever-changing landscape of college admissions, and are concerned about the affordability of college and finding financial aid opportunities.

Olivia (32yo) is a college admissions officer at a reputable university with a Master's degree in Higher Education Administration, seeking to evaluate and select qualified applicants who align with the university's values and academic standards. However, turnout for college admission events have recently been low and unsucessful, so Olivia wants to be able to promote these events to attract and engage prospective students.

Alex (23yo) is a recent college graduate who pursued a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science at a reputable university who now works part-time at a tech company. However, they did not have much information about their Alma Mater before they attended, and would like to share their college experiences, reviews, and ratings to help prospective students.

Testing:
- Given that the user is not registered with the platform, when they view the homepage, then they should receive a message saying to log in and should not be able to access the detailed pages for personalized colleges (they should display the top _ colleges in the country)
- Given that a high school senior inputs their interests/factors in the database, when they view the colleges in my feed, then they should be personalized to them.
- Given that the high school senior has completed all items on their personalized college application checklist, when they view their checklist, then they should receive a success message with confetti.
- Given that a college application deadline is quickly approaching, when the high school senior accesses their personalized colleges page, then they should receive a reminder message.
- Given that there is no child in the website's database (or my input credentials are incorrect), when a parent tries to log into the platform, then they should receive an error.
- Given that the college admission officer does not have a "___@college.edu" email address when they try to log into the platform, then they should receive an error.
