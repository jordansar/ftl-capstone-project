## Problem Statement

High school seniors are often faced with the daunting task of trying to find college that fit their interests to apply to. Our project is a comprehensive online platform designed to assist high school students (specifically seniors) in their college search and application process. It provides a user-friendly interface where students can explore and compare colleges, access valuable information, and make informed decisions about their future education.

## User Roles

Include at least at least 1, but no more than 3, user roles
1. 

## User Personas

Include at least 2 personas per User Role

## User Stories

Include at least 10 user stories.
1. As a high school senior, I want to view a page of colleges personalized for me, so that I can apply to the colleges that fit the most to my interests, background, and future goals.

2. As a parent of a high school senior, I want to be able to log into the platform to view a list of colleges that fit my child, so that I can help them coordinate college tours and information sessions for schools that they are interested in.

3. As a parent of a high school senior, I want to view college tuition of various schools on my personalized college feed, so that I can anticipate the financial factors in my child's college search.

4. As a high schol senior, I want to be able to view review and ratings submitted by current and former college students, so that I can learn firsthand insights into the college experience about the colleges of my interest.

5. As a current college student or alumn, I want to be able to leave reviews on the college I attend(ed) so that I can help current high school seniors learn more about the colleges they are interested in.

6. As a high school senior, I want to view admissions statistics, including acceptance rates, average test scores, GPA requirements, and demographic information for colleges I am interested in, so that I can gauge my chances of acceptance based on historical data and evaluate my fit with different colleges.

7. As a high school senior, I want to view a personalized college application checklist and receive reminders for important deadlines, so that I can stay on top of the required matierals and structure my college application search.

8. As a college admissions officer, I want to be able to provide information, answer questions, and share updates about admission events or virtual campus tours, so that I can showcase my institution to prospective students.



Testing:
- Given that the user is not registered with the platform, when they view the homepage, then they should receive a message saying to log in and should not be able to access the detailed pages for personalized colleges (they should display the top _ colleges in the country)
- Given that a high school senior inputs their interests/factors in the database, when they view the colleges in my feed, then they should be personalized to them.
- Given that the high school senior has completed all items on their personalized college application checklist, when they view their checklist, then they should receive a success message with confetti.
- Given that a college application deadline is quickly approaching, when the high school senior accesses their personalized colleges page, then they should receive a reminder message.
- Given that there is no child in the website's database (or my input credentials are incorrect), when a parent tries to log into the platform, then they should receive an error.
- Given that the college admission officer does not have a "___@college.edu" email address when they try to log into the platform, then they should receive an error.
